== Summary ==
Setup guide for running neural network inference examples using the ZCU104 evaluation board and Xilinx DNNDK framework version 2.08 (current version is 3.0)

== Prerequisites ==
Board setup has been completed according to the reference guides online (or at O:\Docs\Seminars\AI internship\ZCU104 testing\ZCU_Setup) and all COM ports have been assigned correctly. Furthermore, the board has following connections:
*monitor connection via DisplayPort
*ethernet (for ssh access)
*USB for serial communication
*USB 3.0 camera connected to board
*optional: USB mouse and keyboard (use USB Hub)

== Testing the DNNDK samples on the board ==

=== DNNDK setup ===
*DNNDK version 2.08 can be found in O:\Docs\Seminars\AI internship\ZCU104 testing
*download SD card image 2018-12-04-zcu104-desktop-stretch.img.zip version 2.08 from [https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ai-inference/ai-developer-hub.html#edge here]
*write image to SD card
*boot ZCU104 board with SD card inserted and in SD card boot mode
*get IP address of board: 'hostname -I'
*copy the contents of extracted archive xilinx_dnndk_v2.08.7z to the board home directory (or anywhere you want) via SCP (or other method)
*change into directory ZCU104 and run ./install.sh
*some more adjustments necessary:
**copy the contents of the folder: O:\Docs\Seminars\AI internship\ZCU104 testing\ZCU104_mandatory_patch_for_DNNDK to the board
**execute the shell script on the board: './irps5401.sh'
**execute command: 'export DISPLAY=:0.0'
**(it is also possible to have a remote display through ssh -X root@BOARD_IP and executing 'export DISPLAY=BOARD_IP:0.0; however, this is not recommended as the lag introduced via ssh is quite severe for real time video applications)

=== Running the samples ===
*navigate to the ZCU104 samples folder
*inside there are all the sample files that can be run
*to run an example, first change into its directory and run make
*execution of samples via the following commands from inside the respective samples folder
**'./resnet50'
**'./face_detection'
**'./pose_detection /video/pose.mp4'
**'./video_analysis /video/structure.mp4'
**'./inception_v1'
