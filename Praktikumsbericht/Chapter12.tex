\chapter{Week}
This week the first samples of the Mars ST3 base board were available at the company after the usual bring up process for internal use. The bring up typically involves testing the hardware as thoroughly as possible and weed out errors in the \ac{PCB} design and the providing reference designs for the new board, which is compatible with all Mars \ac{FPGA} modules. My task was to make a small \ac{AI} demonstrator using this new base board and a Mars XU3 module. The reason for choosing the XU3 with the Zynq \ac{MPSoC} instead of the smaller Zynq 7000 \ac{SoC} was the compatibility of the Xilinx \ac{DPU} \ac{IP} core. The publicly released version was only suitable for Zynq Ultrascale devices. Support for Zynq 7000 \ac{SoC} would be added in a future release.
