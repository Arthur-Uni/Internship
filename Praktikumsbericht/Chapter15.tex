\chapter{Week}
The majority of this week was spent collecting the data set. Therefore, the data collection setup was build up in the kitchen area and various employees were asked to participate. I went from one to the after I was done with one subject. A total of 10 minutes per subject of data was captured via video. As mentioned before, a Raspberry Pi was used with the script I created to collect the data and automatize as much of the process as possible. During the data set collection I assisted in keeping the movements of the subject in check and talk them through the collection process. For each of the symbols (ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, ILLEGAL) a video of 150 seconds was recorded. After each symbol, a short break was incorporated, as this seemingly small time period already puts a strain on the arm. This process was repeated for any employee that was available.
On Wednesday, I traveled to Lausanne to attend an Intel seminar on \ac{AI} inference with Intel products.
